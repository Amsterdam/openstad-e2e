We are currently testing setting up integration tests for our the following sites:

This is a participatory budgetting site in voting phase, where users need a voting code to be able to vote.

## Submitting ideas site
This is a site where users can sumbit their ideas

## Voting site
A small site where users can vote on ideas with their e-mail

Much more settings and combinations of sites are available in the Openstad system, these will be added step by step.
